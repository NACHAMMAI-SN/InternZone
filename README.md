# InternZone – Intern Management System (PHP/MySQL)

## About This Project
The **InternZone** application is a web-based Intern Management System developed using PHP and MySQL. It helps organizations manage the progress and performance of their interns efficiently.  

The system provides two types of users:  
- **Admin:** Full control over the system to manage interns, programs, tasks, and overall settings.  
- **Intern:** Access to their own data to update task statuses and edit personal information.  

Admins can assign programs and tasks, set deadlines, and monitor progress through a dashboard. Interns can view their assigned tasks and update their statuses. The system also includes filter and sort functionalities for better usability.  

This application can also be adapted for similar use cases, such as managing projects, students, or employees.
